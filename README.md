# DevCamper API

The DevCamper API is the backend for the DevCamper website, providing information about bootcamps and relevant data. The API includes authentication and password reset functionality.

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are example of available endpoints n the API:

- `/api/v1/bootcamps`: Get all bootcamps, create a new bootcamp
- `/api/v1/bootcamps/:id`: Get a single bootcamp, update a bootcamp, delete a bootcamp
- `/api/v1/bootcamps/:id/photo`: Upload a photo for a bootcamp
- `/api/v1/courses`: Get all courses, create a new course
- `/api/v1/courses/:id`: Get a single course, update a course, delete a course
- `/api/v1/auth/register`: Register a new user
- `/api/v1/auth/login`: Login a user
- `/api/v1/auth/logout`: Logout a user
- `/api/v1/auth/me`: Get the current user's profile
- `/api/v1/auth/forgotpassword`: Request a password reset
- `/api/v1/auth/resetpassword/:resettoken`: Reset a user's password

## Authentication

The API requires authentication for some endpoints. To authenticate, send a POST request to `/api/v1/auth/login` with a JSON body containing the user's email and password. The response will include a JWT token that should be included in the headers of subsequent requests.
